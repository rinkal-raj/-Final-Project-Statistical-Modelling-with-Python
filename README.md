# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
 --> The main goal of the project is that collect data of various category from different different apis.
    then validate and filter the data from json format to DataFrame.
    Represent data into visual formate so,easily we can understand the data and create a static model of the data.
--> Another goal is that to improve analyze skills,thinking level,understading data,managing unorganize data and increase 
    level of  coding skills as well as learning skills.


## Process
### COLLECT DATA
    Store API key into environment of machine.
    API variable through call the URL and pass specifice location data.
    Data convert JSON to Data Frame 
    After conver to CSV file
### CLEAN DATA
    Remove duplicate and NULL values from data.
    Remove cloumns which are not required.
    arrange data into proper way.
### SQLITE DATABASE
    Create Sqllite database in pythone
    create table and insert values through CSV files
### VISUALIZATION
    Represent data into various charts and graphs,therefore data looks good and easilly understand.
### REGRESSION MODEL
    It is represent co reation between dependent and independen variable.





## Results
  Results are attached into files

## Challenges 
 Store API key in environment.
 Arrange data into DataFrame.
 Data validation.

## Future Goals
 If i have time i proper analyze data and try to understand data and more i will do with more better with visualization and modelling.
